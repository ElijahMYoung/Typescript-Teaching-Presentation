# Terms Summary

In the TypeScript programming language, the terms "static," "protected," and "private" refer to the accessibility level of class members.

"Static" members are those that can be accessed directly from the class itself, rather than from an instance of the class. This means that static members do not require an object of the class to be instantiated in order to be accessed. This can be useful for methods that are related to the class itself, rather than to specific instances of the class.

"Protected" members are those that can be accessed from within the class and its derived classes, but not from outside the class hierarchy. This is useful for class members that should only be available to derived classes, but not to other classes or objects.

"Private" members are those that can only be accessed from within the class itself. This is useful for class members that should not be accessible from outside the class, as it helps to encapsulate the implementation details of the class and prevent unintended use of the member.

In general, it is good practice to use these accessibility levels in TypeScript to help organize and protect the class members, making the code more maintainable and easier to understand.
