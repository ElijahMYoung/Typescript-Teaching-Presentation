# Abstraction

## What is Abstraction?

In TypeScript, Abstraction is a technique that is used to hide certain details of a class or object, and exposing only the necessary information to the oustside. This allows you to create a simplified version of a complex object or system, and gives a clear separation between the implementation details and the public UI.
