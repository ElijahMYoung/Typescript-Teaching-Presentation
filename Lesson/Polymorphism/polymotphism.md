Polymorphism is a concept in object-oriented programming that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It allows you to create a single interface that can be used to interact with multiple types of objects, and provides a way to write more flexible and generic code.

TypeScript supports polymorphism through the use of interfaces, abstract classes and methods, and classes that implement those interfaces or extend those abstract classes
