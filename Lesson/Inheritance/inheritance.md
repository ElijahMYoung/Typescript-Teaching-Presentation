In object-oriented programming, inheritance is the mechanism that allows a new class to inherit properties and methods from an existing class. The new class is called a derived class, and the existing class is called the base class.

TypeScript supports inheritance through the use of the extends keyword. When a class inherits from another class, it can access the properties and methods of the base class, and can also add new properties and methods of its own. This allows you to reuse existing code and create a hierarchical structure of related classes.
